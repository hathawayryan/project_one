Project One: The Gang Takes on Fantasy Football

An analysis for participants or people interested in participating in Fantasy Football and would like an in-depth look at few factors related to the four main Fantasy Football positions (Quarter Back, Running Back, Wide Receiver, Right End). The scope of the analysis was to find out the values of a plater by position relative to other platers of the same position and if it likely that a plater was start-able one year, if he would be start-able the next year. The analysis also looked at how often drafting a rookie their first year yield a start-able player.  This analysis provides a basis for making draft decisions and predictions in future years and assist with stronger performances withing Fantasy Football leagues.
